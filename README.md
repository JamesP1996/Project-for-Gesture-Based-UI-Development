# Purpose of the Application

The Unity Game is a VR Shooting Range where you can practice destroying targets and set difficulties from Easy (Stagnent) or Hard (Moving) Targets. There is also bottles you can move and setup if you wish to shoot or play with those.

It uses Unity's XR Input System that was released in the past year and is my first attempt at making a VR based game.
It was play test on a Oculus Quest 2 and was a interesting experience to create.

For a more detailed explanation of the Game please read the Documentation within the <b>G00327095 Gesture Project PDF</b> file or read the code comments.
